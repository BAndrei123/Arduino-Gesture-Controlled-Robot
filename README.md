# Arduino-Gesture-Controlled-Robot
The purpose of this project is to implement a hand-controlled robot using Arduino technology. This idea of human-controlled robots is a well-known idea in this field of study and
has lots of very advanced projects that respond to very complex tasks. We will only focus on
the simple task of controlling the movement of the robot by hand gesture

# Motivation

The motivation behind it is to explore human-machine interaction through intuitive hand
gestures, offering a unique and engaging way to control a robotic vehicle. Our educational
motivation is to gain more knowledge about the Arduino microprocessor.
